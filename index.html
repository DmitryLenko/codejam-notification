  <p>But I must explain to you how all this mistaken idea of denouncing of a 
    pleasure and praising pain was born and I will not give you a complete account 
    of the system, and expound the actual teachings of the great explorer of the truth, 
    the master-builder of human happiness. No one rejects, dislikes, or avoids pleasure itself, 
    because it is pleasure, but because those who do not know how to pursue pleasure rationally 
    encounter consequences that are extremely painful. Nor again is there anyone who loves or pursues 
    or desires to obtain pain of itself, because it is pain, but occasionally circumstances occur 
    in which toil and pain can procure him some great pleasure. To take a trivial example, which of 
    us ever undertakes laborious physical exercise, except to obtain some advantage from it? But who 
    has any right to find fault with a man who chooses to enjoy a pleasure that has no annoying consequences, 
    or one who avoids a pain that produces no resultant pleasure?
